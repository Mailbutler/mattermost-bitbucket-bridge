# Bitbucket Webhook Bridge (BWB) for Mattermost

This repository is contains a Python Flask application that accepts webhooks from [Bitbucket
Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server) and forwards them to the specified
channel in a [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) server via an incoming webhook. The bridge application
supports a number of usage scenarios including:

* One Bitbucket repository to one Mattermost incoming webhook (one to one);
* Many Bitbucket repositories to many Mattermost incoming webhooks (many to many) and;
* Many Bitbucket repositories to one Mattermost incoming webhook (many to one).

Information on setting up for the different usage scenarios can be found below.
 
 **Import Notes**:
 * This application has only been tested with Bitbucket Server 5.10.1. 
 * This application is an example of how to bridge Bitbucket webhooks to Mattermost and is not 
 meant to be used in a production environment.

## Setup the Flask Application

The following steps

1. Log into the machine that will host the Python Flask application;
2. Clone this repository to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/cvitter/mattermost-bitbucket-bridge.git`;
3. Make a copy of `config.sample`: `cp config.sample config.json`
4. Edit `config.json` to update the following fields as needed:
   * Application host address and port (generally debug should be left set to `false`;
   * Mattermost server_url and the user name or icon to override the webhook with if desired;
   * And the base url of your Bitbucket server.
5. Run the Flask application - there are a number of ways to run the application but I use the following command that runs the application headlessly and captures output into a log file for troubleshooting:

```
sudo python bitbucket.py >> bitbucket.log 2>&1 &
```

# Configure Mattermost



# Configure Bitbucket

Within Bitbucket webhooks are configured and managed at the individual repository level. From within a repository click on the `Repository Settings` icon (cog) in the left hand side bar and then click on Webhooks under repository settings. To create a new webhook click on the `Create webhook` button. In the `Create webhook` form fill in the new webhook's `Name` and `URL`. The URL will look like:

```
http://flask-application-url:port/hooks/[hookcode]
```
**Note**: The hook code is the unique hook identifier generated by Mattermost and is found at the end of your Mattermost's incoming webhook URL, ex: `https://mymattermostserver.com/hooks/5iz1k8j8rbdjjyu3anbw4u66qe`.

Then select the `Repository` and `Pull request` events you want to be notified about and click on `Create` to create the webhook.
